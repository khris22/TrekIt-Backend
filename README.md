# trekIt (Backend)

trekIt is an app for everybody who wants to track their outdoor adventures. This app uses Geocoder to help you search a particular location/park on the web and Mapbox to visually render your own map of adventures.

There are 2 repositories to have the trekIt app working. Please clone both links:

1. Ruby on Rails Backend: [https://github.com/khris22/TrekIt-Backend](https://github.com/khris22/TrekIt-Backend)
2. ReactJs-Redux Frontend: [https://github.com/khris22/TrekIt-Frontend](https://github.com/khris22/TrekIt-Frontend)

## Overview

trekIt is a Reactjs-Redux Single Page Application (SPA) with a backend Ruby on Rails API. This app allows the user to choose a location using Geocoder and save it on their list. Once the location is saved, the user can now start tracking their adventures for that saved location. This app has a functionality to delete a particular location as well as the adventure saved. It also gives the user the ability to edit their adventures.
